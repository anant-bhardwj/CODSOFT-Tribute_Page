            <p>Renowned actor Alan Rickman, a former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company rose to fame
             with his portrayal of the Vicomte de Valmont in ‘Les Liaisons Dangereuses’. The versatile
              stage actor made an easy transition into films though for a while he faced the danger of 
              being typecast as a villain actor after his portrayal of Hans Gruber in ‘Die Hard’. He 
              did not posses the prominent features or the unsettling glint in his eyes which one normally
               associates with a villain, but he had something else that made him suitable for such 
               characters. He had a personal aura of unpredictability and sophistication that made him 
               the perfect choice for playing the suave villain in style. The fact that he became typecast
                as a villain actor after just one film is a testimony to the acting skills of this great 
                artist.</p>

                <p>Actor Alan Sydney Patrick Rickman was born on February 21, 1946, in West London, England.
                He was the second of four children born to Bernard Rickman, an Irish Catholic factory 
                worker, and Margaret Doreen Rose Rickman, a Welsh Methodist housewife. After showing 
                an early predilection for art, Rickman won a scholarship to Latymer Upper School in
                London, where he appeared in several school plays, and then studied graphic design at 
                Chelsea College of Art and Design and the Royal College of Art. After graduating, he 
                started a graphic design company, Graphiti, with some friends. He met his lifetime 
                partner Rima Horton in 1965 while in the amateur Group Court Drama Club.</p>

                <p>Rickman's major high-profile role came in the 2000s, when he 
                    took on the key part of Professor Severus Snape in the Harry
                     Potter movies. Author J.K. Rowling specifically wanted Rickman
                      for the role, briefing him on unpublished backstory about 
                      the character to help him prepare for the role. Rickman went
                       on to play the role in all eight Harry Potter films.</p>

                <p>Rickman's other films in the 2000s include Love Actually (2003), Snow Cake (2006), Nobel Son (2007) and Bottle Shock (2008). 
                    He twice collaborated with Tim Burton, in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) and Alice in Wonderland (2010).
                    Following the Harry Potter films, Rickman starred in a number of diverse film roles, including playing Ronald Reagan in Lee Daniels 
                    'The Butler' (2013) and Karl Hoffmeister in A Promise (2013). Also that year, he took on the role of Hilly Kristal, the owner of the 
                    famous New York City punk rock club in CBGB. From Bowery club owner to royalty, Rickman portrayed King Louis XIV in A Little Chaos (2014).</p>
